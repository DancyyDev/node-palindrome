# Palindrome Checker

## Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules to validate if a string is a palindrome server side.

### How it's made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I wanted to learn how to create the condtitional code on node.js and have it shown through the browser. I created a  the input takes the string, splits it into an array, reverse the array, and then join it to create our new string. I then compared the new string and the input string to see if the word matches. If it's a match, it is a palindrome, if it doesn't then it is not a palindrome.

### Lessons learned:

I learned to how to create a logical code on the backend side of coding and was able to understand what I was coding out.
